# giphy
What this project is:  This project is intended to allow a user to select a sport (or anything really) and render gif images onto the screen.
How it works:  This project uses the Giphy API.  The js file takes the text from the button clicked, and runs a query for that topic in the Giphy API.  It then renders GIF's from Giphy onto the screen.  They initialize as a still image, and then when clicked it turns into the actual GIF.
